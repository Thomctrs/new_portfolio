## Project objective



>Resources owned by all

With a group of 5 students from different courses at ISEN Brest, our aim was to carry out a social survey on controversies linked to resources and the owned by all. 

So, after some research and debate, we chose a subject dealing with **the French exploitation of lithium to ensure national energy sovereignty**.

### A podcast with experts on the subject

As this is a social issue on many different levels, we had to produce a podcast by interviewing experts on the subject, local people affected by the construction of new mines and representatives of major private groups. Members of government are also prominent players on this issue.

These different points of view are crucial to understanding the complexity of the issue and why the situation cannot satisfy everyone.
