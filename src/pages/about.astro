				<div class="content">
					<p>
						My name is Thomas Catros, I'm 22. I'm currently student in first year of master degree at the engineer school
						ISEN Brest, France. Through my first year in health studies and my preparatory class in BIOST at ISEN I have developed
						a strong interest in the human biologie sciences. I had opportunities to study subjects such as Cell Biology, Biochemistry, 
						Human Physiology, Genetics, Pharmaco-Toxicology and Microbiology. 
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						However, during my studies at ISEN, computer sciences became a real passion. That's why i decided to opt for 
						the professional field of software engineering. 
						It seemed important to me to acquire as much technical knowledge as possible during my studies.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>Alongside my studies, I'm involved in the school's community life. I'm in charge of events for the student office
						for the second time, and I try to liven up the students' daily lives with all sorts
						of activities: integration, parties, games, weekends, conferences, etc.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						Sport is a real obsession for me. I'm currently playing my 17th year of football at Plouhinec Football Club
						in the Regional 2 division. This experience give me priceless qualities like teamwork, self discipline and strengh to constantly pushing
						 my limits further. I am also a fast-learner with a strong ability to work both independently and with a team.
